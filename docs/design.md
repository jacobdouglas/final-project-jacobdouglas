# Design

This page is where you give a very brief description of the different tables and views that you wrote. This is also a good place to justify any of your choices when it comes to what columns you wanted to include, or what data types you used. You don't need to comment on obvious/uncontroversial choices.

This page is a great place to put links to schema diagrams (you can use more than one) [like this](imgs/included/classicmodels.png) or your [Workbook file](files/classicmodels.mwb).

For an excellent professional example of a design page, including diagrams, see the [Early American Foreign Service Database](http://projectquincy.org/images/ProjectQuincy12-11-2012.pdf)
