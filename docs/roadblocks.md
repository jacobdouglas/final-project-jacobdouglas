# Roadblocks

Describe how your overall process progressed. You can share any particular victories here, if you wish, but you should also share obstacles you ran into. Roadblocks can be general in nature (e.g. difficulty of obtaining data, normalizing it, etc..), or they can also be very specific (difficulties trying to get a certain query to work right, or a certain column not acting as expected). Most importantly, reflect on how you might deal with these problems if you were to attempt it again. What advice would you give to someone else trying this project?
